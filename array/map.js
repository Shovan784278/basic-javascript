/* here are some real-life problems that can be solved using map:

1. Problem: You have an array of numbers representing temperatures in Celsius, and you want to create a new array with the temperatures converted to Fahrenheit.

2. Problem: You have an array of objects representing products with a price property, and you want to create a new array with the prices converted to a different currency.

3. Problem: You have an array of objects representing books with a title property, and you want to create a new array with the titles converted to uppercase.

4. Problem: You have an array of strings representing names, and you want to create a new array with the names sorted alphabetically.

5. Problem: You have an array of objects representing students with a grade property, and you want to create a new array with the grades converted to letter grades (e.g. A, B, C, etc.). */
