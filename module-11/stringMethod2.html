        let name = "Bangladesh";

        //let result = name.substr(0,6); // In this method we can cut (0,6)..here 0 means index number 0 and it's length that means 6.


        let result = name.substring(6,10); // In this method substring(6,10) is almost same as sustr().. But one difference is substring length is start from 1.. Such as "Bangladesh". Here B starts from length 1 and ends with 10.
